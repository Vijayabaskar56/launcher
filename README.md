This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React Native, Expo, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting & formatting)
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Initialize hooks: `bun run prepare`
- Format and lint fix: `bun run check`
